## How to Play

Triple Triad Memory is a card-matching memory game. The rules are simple:

1. Click on a card to reveal its image.
2. Click on another card to find a matching pair.
3. If the cards match, they will remain face-up.
4. If they don't match, they will be flipped face-down again.
5. Keep matching pairs until all cards are face-up to win the game.

You can play the game live on [Triple Triad Memory](https://tripletriadmemory.netlify.app).
